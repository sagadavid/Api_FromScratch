		• If we are registering the dependency using AddScoped, AddSingleton or AddTransient 
			method then they will replace the service in the
			collection if it has already been registered in the container.
		• Now If we use the Try version like TryAddScoped then it will only
			register the service if it was not registered earlier. In case service was 
			already registered then the TryAddScoped will skip the registration for that service.
